    KP-Bittorrent client 
</h1>

<ul>
<li>Downloading movie, music perhaps game or very large size software if pretty
fun activity using <strong>Bittorrent communication protocol</strong> which helps in
distributing large chunks of data over Internet. Fact is that <strong>one third of
internet traffic contains Bittorrent data packets</strong>, which makes it one of 
most interesting and trending topics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Architecture</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The traditional client-server model is obviously not scalable when many
clients are requesting single server, this leads us to P2P architecture in
which instead of centrailzed server, the peers or clients or end hosts itself
participate in distributing data among themself.</p>

<p><img src="./images/p2p.png" alt="Peer to peer architecture" title="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Bittorrent is protocol defined for sharing/exchange of data in peer to peer
architecture designed by designed by <strong>Bram Cohen</strong>. The purpose of Bittorrent
Protocol or BTP/1.0 was to achieve <strong>advantage over plain HTTP when multiple
downloads are possible</strong>. I would recommend reading this page which gives
details about <a href="https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification">BTP/1.0</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Bittorrent</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Amazon Web Services(AWS) <strong>Simple Storage Service</strong>(S3) is scalable internet
based storage service with interface equipped with built-in Bittorrent.</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook uses BitTorrent to distribute updates to Facebook servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Major open-source free software support their file sharing using Bittorrent 
inorder to reduce load on their servers. Example - ubantu iso files.</p></li>
<li><p>Government of UK used Bittorrent to distribute the details of the tax money
spend by the cittizens.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong> - BitTorrent had 100 million users and a greater share of network 
  bandwidth than Netflix and Hulu combined.</p>

<h2>Bittorrent Client</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Bittorrent protocol is application layer protocol, since it replies on the
services provided by the lower 4 levels of TCP/IP Internet model for sharing
the data. It is the application layer where the Bittorrent Client is written
such that following a set of rules or protocols it will exchange the data
among the peers(ends hosts).</p></li>
<li><p>In the project, I have made bittorrent client application program in
python3, which follows the Bittorrent protocols for downloading and
uploading files among serveral peers. </p></li>
</ul>
